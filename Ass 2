 * This function takes two parameters:
 * 1) blocks - an array storing the number of blocks remains for each block size. For instance, blocks[0]
 * should store how many 'Size 1' blocks are remaining and blocks[4] should store how many 'Size 5' blocks are remaining.
 * 2) size - a variable that may be useful when constructing your recursion.
 *
 * When this function is called in the main program, the variable "size" is always set as BOARD_SIZE.
 *
 * //UPDATED HERE @ 18/10/2017 
 * Example, assume the blocks array is {0, 1, 0, 2}; this should return 2;
 *                 the blocks array is {2, 0, 0, 1}; this should return 1;
 *                 the blocks array is {0, 0, 1, 2}; this should return 3; etc.
 *
 * Note, if the blocks array contains only 0s (all blocks are used), this should return BOARD_SIZE + 1.

 * 3) direction d, the direction you want to put a block, either downward (DOWN) or towards right (RIGHT)
 * 4) the size of a block
 *
 * If there is enough empty spot to place the block, the function shall fill the locations of the board with
 * OCCUPIED (x) and it should return true to its caller.

/**
 * @TODO
 *
 * This function should determine if there is any "checkmate move". A checkmate move is a valid move that 
 * if a player makes that move, his opponent will lose the game immediately. If there is such case, the 
 * function should return true and assign that move to the variables row, col, direction, size. If there is no
 * "checkmate move" the function should return false and the reference variables should not be modified.
 *
 * Similar to the above functions, row and col should be representing the top-left corner of the position
 * of the block and direction should be either RIGHT or DOWN that represents towards right or downward.
 * The variable size is the size of the block and it is required there are still unused blocks of that size
 * available, that is, blocks[size - 1] > 0.
 *
 * This function requires the status of board and the remaining number of blocks and they are supplied in the
 * array board and blocks respectively. You can assume the size of these two arrays are always "correct" when
 * it is tested. That is, you don't need to worry about if board or blocks have insufficient sizes and leading
 * array out of bound.
 *
 * When this function is called in the main program or our testing code, the variables will be set as:
 * row = 0, col = 0, direction = RIGHT, size = 1
 *
 * Note, it is possible to have more than one checkmate move. In this case you are required to assign ANY ONE
 * of the checkmate moves into the variables row, col, direction, size.
